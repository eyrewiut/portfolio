# Personal site
This repository holds the sourcecode for my personal site, which includes my portfolio and a small blog.
The site uses NetlifyCMS to generate blog posts and other content as markdown files, and the html markup is generated using Astro.
UnoCSS is used because atomic css is a quick and dirty, and users won't care how the site works behind the scenes.
